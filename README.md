non-LEE-encoded effector (nle) gene sequences
McCarthy SC, Macori G

Introduction
Database containing non-LEE-encoded effector (nle) gene sequences that can be used for predicting the presence of these genes from genomic sequences of Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). EPECs use a type III secretion system (T3SS), encoded in the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island to promote colonisation.
